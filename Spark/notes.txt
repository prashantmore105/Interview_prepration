------------------------is Dataframe immutable or not-----------------------

As per Spark Architecture DataFrame is built on top of RDDs which are immutable in nature, Hence Data frames are immutable in nature as well.

Regarding the withColumn or any other operation for that matter, when you apply such operations on DataFrames it will generate a new data frame instead of updating the existing data frame.

However, When you are working with python which is dynamically typed language you overwrite the value of the previous reference. Hence when you are executing below statement

df = df.withColumn()
It will generate another dataframe and assign it to reference "df".

In order to verify the same, you can use id() method of rdd to get the unique identifier of your dataframe.

df.rdd.id()

will give you unique identifier for your dataframe.
